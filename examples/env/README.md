# Environment variables

This test case is demonstrating how to use environment variables to set up the configuration parameters.

> Configuration parameters may be set up from the command-line, configuration file, and environment variables. And they have different priorities. Please read the [Configuration](https://www.dbinvent.com/rdbm/guide/configuration) article to learn the details.

## Running the test

```shell
