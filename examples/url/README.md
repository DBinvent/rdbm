# Connection URI

This test case is demonstrating how to use [Connection URI](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-connect.html) in a single `db_url` param rather than providing several params such us: `db_host`, `db_name`, `db_user` and `db_password` in the configuration file.

## Running the test

```shell
../test.sh url
```
